# Python_Basic_Statistics

This repository is developed to share some basic statistics related code developed in Python. 

Currently, it has examples related to the topics below:

1- Linear Regression 

2- Power law fits for galaxy integral and differential source counts. 

For more details read: (Rahman & Iqbal 2019) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1063772919070072 or https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08226

Hopefully, this will be of some help.
